VPython CVS is maintained at cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython
Anonymous access is via pserver, as user anonymous, empty password.

Mainline development is taking place in the "vpython-core2" module.

Set the version number appropriately in configure.ac, 
and in the first line of __init__.py.

Windows and Mac builds are now special to them; 
see VCBuild/VCBuild.txt and MAC-OSX.txt.

For Linux:

Makefile.in, configure, and the helper programs for them are not maintained
in CVS. You will have to run the autogen.sh script after a fresh checkout to 
create configure. Except on Windows, you need to execute "chmod +x autogen.sh"
in order to be able to execute ./autogen.sh. 

The result of executing autogen.sh is to produce the following files:
	configure (from configure.ac and acinclude.m4)
	Makefile.in (from Makefile.am)
	aclocal.m4
	config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh, missing

The source distribution is built with "make dist-bzip2"  "make bzip" is also
supported.

Please provide patches in unified diff format, as generated with
$ cvs diff -u

This project uses tabs for indentation in C++, and spaces in Python.

We do not use a separate developer's mailing list, so please direct any 
development-related questions to visualpython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
