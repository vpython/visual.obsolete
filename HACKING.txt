VPython CVS is maintained at cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython
Anonymous access is via pserver, as user anonymous, empty password.

Mainline development is taking place in the "vpython" module.  The modules 
"cvisual", "Programs", "visual", and "installer" contain the mainline source 
changes prior to December 22, 2004, and are no longer maintained.  Experimental
development is taking place in the "vpython-core2" module at this time.

Set the version number appropriately in configure.ac, 
and in the first line of __init__.py.

Makefile.in, configure, and the helper programs for them are not maintained
in CVS. You will have to run the autogen.sh script after a fresh checkout to 
create configure. Except on Windows, you need to execute "chmod +x autogen.sh"
in order to be able execute ./autogen.sh. 

If you are using Windows, you will need MinGW, MSYS, and the 
MSYS-DTK from www.mingw.org. You will also need to install 
msys-automake, msys-autoconf, and msys-libtool.

The source distribution is built with "make dist-bzip2"  "make bzip" is also
supported.

Please provide patches in unified diff format, as generated with
$ cvs diff -u

This project uses tabs for indentation in C++, and spaces in Python.

We do not use a separate developer's mailing list, so please direct any 
development-related questions to visualpython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
