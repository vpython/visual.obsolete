threadpool
----------

From threadpool.sf.net.  A very simple thread pooling library based on Boost.Thread (no 
platform dependent code).  Might become part of boost someday.

The version of threadpool must match the version of Boost.
Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/threadpool and choose Download,
then click the threadpool link in the Package column.
Click on the "clipboard" icon for each package to see what Boost version is required.
As of March 2009, here is what one finds:
0.2.5 boost::thread 1.37
0.2.4 boost::thread 1.35
