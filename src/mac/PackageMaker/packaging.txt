This is the start of instructions for creating a Mac installer.

To use the Apple Package Manager to create an installer, create a folder named "stage"
at the same level as vpython-core2. 

Place in stage:
	Files that will go to site-packages:
		visual folder (from vpython-core2/site-packages)
		vidle
		numpy files (two folders)
	
	Files that will go to Applications/VPython:
	VPython/examples folder
	VPython/docs folder
	VPython/VIDLE startup

Clean out irrelevant files from these folders (e.g. CVS folders, make files).

Ctrl-click the stage folder and choose Get Info.
Expose Sharing & Permissions.
Click the lock and enter your password.
Set "everyone" to have Read & Write acess.
At the bottom of the window, click the star menu icon and choose "Apply to enclosed items".
	This is necessary to permit someone to install over an existing installation.

Now go to PackageMaker folder and doubleclick the package manager file.
Build the installer.
