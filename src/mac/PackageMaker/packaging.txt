Instructions for creating a Mac installer.

To use the Apple Package Manager to create an installer, create a folder named "stage"
at the same level as vpython-core2. 

Place in stage:
	Files that will go to site-packages:
		visual folder (from vpython-core2/site-packages)
		vidle (from vpython-core2/site-packages or site-packages)
		numpy files (folder and file from site-packages)
	
	
	Files that will go to Applications/VPython:
	VPython/examples folder
	VPython/docs folder
	VPython/VIDLE launcher (unzip from src/mac/PackageMaker/VIDLE_launcher.zip)

Clean out irrelevant files from these folders (e.g. CVS folders, make files).

The VIDLE launcher was created starting from the launcher created by cd-ing to 
site-packages/vidle and executing "python MacBuildApp.py build". This produced a
launcher VIDLE.app which seemed to lack robustness and often failed to run. 
If you right-click (ctrl-click) VIDLE.app, you can gain access to the contents
of what is actually a folder. The Python scripts VIDLE and idle.py were edited
with TextEdit to be very simple. They contain specific references to Python 2.6
and so will need to be revised for later versions of Python.

Ctrl-click the stage folder and choose Get Info.
Expose Sharing & Permissions.
Click the lock and enter your password.
Set "everyone" to have Read & Write acess.
At the bottom of the window, click the star menu icon and choose "Apply to enclosed items".
	This is necessary to permit someone to install over an existing installation.

Now go to PackageMaker folder and doubleclick the package manager file.
Choose Project > Install Properties to specify the minimum operating system required.
For the VPython folder component, click the folder in the left panel and highlight
the Components tab. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure that Allow Relocation for VIDLE.app is NOT checked.
This must be every time you build the installer; the setting is not saved.

Build the installer.
