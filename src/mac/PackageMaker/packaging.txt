This is the start of instructions for creating a Mac installer.

To use the Apple Package Manager to create an installer, create a folder named "stage"
at the same level as vpython-core2. 

Place in stage a copy of 
	the visual folder (from vpython-core2/site-packages)
	the examples folder
	the docs folder

Clean out irrelevant files from these folders (e.g. CVS folders, .in files).

Add to stage a copy of the numpy files (two folders).

Ctrl-click the stage folder and choose Get Info.
Expose Sharing & Permissions.
Click the lock and enter your password.
Set "everyone" to have Read & Write acess.
At the bottom of the window, click the star menu icon and choose "Apply to enclosed items".
	This is necessary to permit someone to install over an existing installation.

Now go to PackageMaker folder and doubleclick the package manager file.
Build the installer.
