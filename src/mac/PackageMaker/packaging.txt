This is the start of instructions for creating a Mac installer.

To use the Apple Package Manager to create an installer, create a folder named "stage"
at the same level as vpython-core2. 

Place in stage a copy of 
	the visual folder (from vpython-core2/site-packages)
	the examples folder
	the docs folder

Clean out irrelevant files from these folders (e.g. CVS folders, .in files).

Add to stage a copy of the numpy files.

Now go to PackageMaker folder and doubleclick the package manager file.
Build the installer.
