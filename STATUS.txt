Started 2008/4/7 as a place to record the status of Visual 5 on various platforms

This has mostly been superseded by a google doc used by the developers in
the run-up to making a release.

Scherer: Things certainly shouldn't be twice as fast in Linux as XP!  
If that was ever true, it's probably been fixed.
Linux and the Mac, as I've warned you before, are currently not defining the 
NDEBUG macro and so are using a bunch of extremely slow OpenGL error checking, 
which is not present on Windows in Release mode. That could account for some 
of the speed difference.
(I had forgotten about the NDEBUG issue.)
