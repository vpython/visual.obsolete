Started 2008/4/7 as a place to record the status of Visual 4 on various platforms

Need to correct docs/visual/mouse.html: there are FIVE mouse events, including "release".

Bruce office Dell 2008/9/11 (XP)

Serious bug with back clipping plane in gas.py and when you
rotate and zoom in texture_and_lighting.py.

Should make improvements to texturetest.py.

DS working on rings: rings look much thinner in hanoi.py than they do in Visual 3.
Same in 18_Erings2.

Zoomed out too far:
boxlighttest, faces_heightfield, colorsliders, hanoi, lathe, toroid, toroid_drag,
04_speed_of_sound, 07_quantum_oscillator, 07_spectrum, 09_Rutherford_dist_PRIVATE,
10_drop_clay, 10_wheel_L, 12_carnot (BIG effect), 13_E_dipole_step_PRIVATE,
21_Gauss_2win (BIG effect when you choose an option)

03_Moon_Voyage_PRIVATE.py 4.7 s (0.01 years) in Visual 3, 5.4 s in Visual 4.

threebody.py "Show Energy" too wide for the controls button it's on.
Similar problem in fields.py.

Would help in graph.py to show a small point where the plotting currently is.

Serious bug with thick line in 09_alpha_on_alpha; during early part of motion
the target trail is an infinitely long blue line going through the two particles.
Change to thin line, no problem. Similar in 09_alpha_on_electron. Problem lasts
longer in 09_alpha_on_gold_PRIVATE.

23_Radiation3D.py: Briefly see sphere that fills the window before autoscaling of
other stuff kicks in. Could we do anything to suppress these transients?

helix doesn't take extra arguments in the constructor.

For those programs (gas, stars) that are different between Numeric and numpy, should
use "try" to set a flag and make the programs run either way.

Kill windows, IDLE lingers without redisplaying (but new run deletes old window).

---------------------------

Scherer: Things certainly shouldn't be twice as fast in Linux as XP!  
If that was ever true, it's probably been fixed.
Linux and the Mac, as I've warned you before, are currently not defining the 
NDEBUG macro and so are using a bunch of extremely slow OpenGL error checking, 
which is not present on Windows in Release mode. That could account for some 
of the speed difference.
(I had forgotten about the NDEBUG issue.)
