This directory is a kind of sandbox that I'm using to build and test and build a new OpenGL rendering engine for VPython.

TODO:
Port to Win32/wGL.
Investigate port to native Mac/Carbon.
Transparency for the ring object.
Textures for rings?
Complete implementation of frame.
Write new implementations of:
	curve,
	convex,
	faces,
	label

Possible new objects:
	face_strip


Final:
Fold back into VPython.
