This directory is a kind of sandbox that I'm using to build 
and test a new OpenGL rendering engine for VPython.

Directory layout
SConstruct
	A scons build file for this project.  Run `scons` to build the
	application. (not tested with OSX/gtk1, yet).
bin/  
	Programs are built in-place here.
lib/
	Target libraries are built in-place here.
include/
	Header files for the basic objects.
include/util/
	Header files for utility classes, like tmatrix, and vector.
include/gtk1/
	Classes for Gtk 1.2 + gtkglarea
include/gtk2/
	Classes for Gtkmm + GtkGLExtmm
src/core/
	Implementations of classes defined in include/
src/core/util/
	same, for include/util/
src/gtk1/
	same, for include/gtk1
src/gtk2/
	same, for include/gtk2
src/test/
	A series of test programs used to excersize the individiual
	parts of this library.
	

TODO (*-ed items are must-do, w/l items are wishlist items):
	Use a proper toolbar for the default view widget.
	* Port to Win32/wGL. 
	Investigate port to native Mac/Carbon (or even Mac/Cocoa).
	* Transparency for rings.
	Textures for rings?
	* omplete implementation of frame.
	* Write new implementations of:
		curve,
		convex,
		faces,
		label (blocking on text research, below).
	Snapshot/screenshot support for the display object.

	Possible new objects:
		face_strip
		* a texture loader that reads from a Numeric array.

	More research: 
		* FTGL.  In particular texture-mapped text and UTF-8 
			(or other i18n) support.
		
		w/l Figure out how the 'bumps' program in xscreensavers-gl does 
			textured bump-mapping.
		w/l Semi-automatic algorithmic texture generation.

	* Final:
		Fold back into VPython.
