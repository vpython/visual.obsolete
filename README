This directory is a kind of sandbox that I'm using to build 
and test a new OpenGL rendering engine for VPython.

Directory layout
SConstruct
	A scons build file for this project.  Run `scons` to build the
	application. (not tested with OSX/gtk1, yet).
bin/  
	Programs are built in-place here.
lib/
	Target libraries are built in-place here.
include/
include/util/
	Header files for utility classes, like tmatrix, and vector.
include/gtk1/
	Classes for Gtk 1.2 + gtkglarea
include/gtk2/
	Classes for Gtkmm + GtkGLExtmm
src/core/
	Implementations of classes defined in include/
src/core/util/
	same, for include/util/
src/gtk1/
	same, for include/gtk1
src/gtk2/
	same, for include/gtk2
src/test/
	A series of test programs used to excersize the individiual
	parts of this library.
	

TODO:
Port to Win32/wGL.
Investigate port to native Mac/Carbon.
Transparency for the ring object.
Textures for rings?
Complete implementation of frame.
Write new implementations of:
	curve,
	convex,
	faces,
	label

Possible new objects:
	face_strip

More research: FTGL.  In particular texture-mapped text, UTF-8.


Final:
Fold back into VPython.
