<h2 align="center">Summary of new features in VPython 4.0</h2>
<p align="center"><a href="index.html">Back to contents</a></p>
<h3>Opacity</h3>
<p>You can make most objects be partially transparent by specifying a value from 
  0-1 inclusive for the attribute &quot;opacity&quot;. For example, box(color=color.red, 
  alpha=0.8) is slightly transparent. An opacity value of 0 means totally transparent, 
  and 1 means totally opaque. Currently curves and helixes do not allow transparency. 
  (Currently you can use the synonym &quot;alpha&quot; for &quot;opacity&quot;, 
  but &quot;alpha&quot; is deprecated.)</p>
<h3>Surface textures</h3>
<p>You can create a texture object and then apply it to the surface of an object. 
  This capability is currently limited to boxes and spheres. A surface texture 
  is an M by N array of 1, 2, 3, or 4 numerical values (a list or tuple). M and 
  N must be powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.). Here are the possible values 
  for each slot in the array:</p>
<p>1 value: texture type must be &quot;luminance&quot; (how bright) or &quot;opacity&quot;</p>
<p>2 values (opacity,luminance): texture type must be &quot;opacity_luminance&quot;</p>
<p>3 values (red,green,blue): texture type must be &quot;rgb&quot;</p>
<p>4 values (red,green,blue,opacity or alpha): texture type must be &quot;rgbo&quot;</p>
<p>A VPython texture is basically a mask. For example, if you apply a texture 
  to a box that is red, any cyan region of the texture will display as black, 
  because the cyan (0,1,1) doesn't overlap at all with the red (1,0,0).</p>
<p>You can create a numeric array of zeros in various formats, then assign values:</p>
<p>zeros([...], UnsignedInt8) means an integer 0-255<br>
  zeros([...], Int16) means an integer 0-32767<br>
  zeros([...], Int) means an integer 0-2147483648<br>
  zeros([...], Float) means a floating-point (fractional) number 0-1</p>
<p>Here is an example program in which a checkerboard texture is created and applied 
  to a box:</p>
<p>from visual import *<br>
  M=4 # must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)<br>
  N=4 # must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)<br>
  checks = zeros([M,N], Float) # create a numeric array of floating-point zeros 
  (0.0) <br>
  for i in range(M):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for j in range(N):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((i&amp;1) ^ (j&amp;1)): 
  # true for every alternate square of the checkerboard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks[i][j] 
  = 1.0<br>
  print checks<br>
  lum = texture(data=checks, type=&quot;luminance&quot;)<br>
  box(color=color.cyan, texture=lum)</p>
<p>If you wanted to create a texture containing &quot;rgb&quot; values, you would 
  start with zeros([M,N,3], Float), and entries into this array would be the usual 
  (red,green,blue) triples, with values for each color in the range 0-1 inclusive.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://vpython.org/contributed.html" target="_blank">contributed</a> 
  section of vpython.org for an example of a program to create, save, and use 
  a wood-grain texture.</p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>Objects now have a &quot;shininess&quot; attribute which by default is 0.5. 
  A shininess of 0 means no specular highlights. A shininess of 1 means strong 
  specular highlights. You can also for special purposes specify an attribute 
  &quot;lit&quot; to False (or 0) in which case lights have no effect on it.</p>
<p>For compatibility with past programs, there is still a list of lights in scene.lights, 
  and you can still manipulate those lights as before. However, those lights were 
  restricted to being very far (&quot;at infinity&quot;) from the scene. Now you 
  can create lights that are nearby, and if you wish they can be spotlights with 
  directed beams. The following statement creates a local blue light positioned 
  at (x,y,z):</p>
<p>bl = light(pos=(x,y,z), color=color.blue, local=True)</p>
<p>Note that if you continually update bl.pos, the light will move.</p>
<p>By default, local is True. If you set local = False, the light is at infinity, 
  in a direction given by pos.</p>
<p>Other attributes are spot_direction (a vector), spot_cutoff (half angle of 
  the beam in degrees), diffuse_color, and specular_color. The attribute attentuation=(const, 
  linear, quadratic) makes the light diminish with distance d according to the 
  formula 1/(const + linear*d +quadratic*d). The default is (1,0,0). OpenGL guarantees 
  to permit a minimum of seven lights.</p>
<p>If you want to disable all of the old lights, say scene.lights = [], making 
  an empty list of old lights.</p>
<h3>Points object</h3>
<p>A new points object can be plotted in &quot;screen&quot; size as well as the 
  usual &quot;world&quot; coordinates. Like curve, the pos attribute is a list 
  of points, as is color. If antialias is True, the points are round; by default 
  they are square. The size attribute is in screen pixels if the type attribute 
  is &quot;screen&quot; (the default), but if type is &quot;world&quot;, the size 
  is in the usual coordinates. A good use for the new object is for the gdots 
  displayed using visual.graph. These used to be awkward labels using the letter 
  &quot;o&quot; but have been replaced with screen-pixel points.</p>
<p> Technical caveats: If the &quot;GL_ARB_point_parameters&quot; property is 
  shown in scene.info() then type = &quot;world&quot; will work. Otherwise the 
  type is silently ignored and considered to be &quot;screen&quot;. There is an 
  implementation-defined size range for either round or square points, which is 
  not easily visible to programs at this time. Specifying a size outside this 
  range will cause it to be silently clamped internally to whatever range that 
  the hardware supports.</p>
<h3>New frame capabilities</h3>
<p>You can now make a frame visible or invisible, and all objects in the frame 
  will be affected. And you can set the vector &quot;scale&quot; attribute of 
  a frame to change the size of the combined object.</p>
<h3>Fonts in labels</h3>
<p>You can now specify font='times' or 'system' or 'symbol' etc. in a label object.
