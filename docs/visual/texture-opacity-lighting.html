<h2 align="center">Summary of new features in the VPython version 4 beta release </h2>
<p align="center"><a href="index.html">Back to contents</a></p>
<h3>Beta release</h3>
<p>This beta release is experimental in the sense that there are known bugs described 
  <a href="#bugs">below</a>. Feel free to play with the exciting new features, 
  but be aware that you may encounter problems.</p>
<p>There is a new example program texture_and_lighting.py that displays many of 
  the new features: a swinging spotlight illuminates a translucent beach ball 
  that rolls on a wood-texture table. Also see the
  example program boxlighttest.py.</p>
<h3>New toolbar with &quot;pan&quot; mode </h3>
<p>At the top of a graphics window is a toolbar with an icon to change right-button dragging
  to &quot;pan&quot; rather than rotate (and another icon to switch back). There are also
  icons to exit the program, switch
  to or from full-screen mode, and  reset to a standard camera position. </p>
<h3>Opacity</h3>
<p>You can make most objects be partially transparent by specifying a value from
   0-1 inclusive for the attribute &quot;opacity&quot;. For example, box(color=color.red,
    opacity=0.8) is slightly transparent. An opacity value of 0 means totally
   transparent, 
  and 1 means totally opaque. Currently curve, convex, face, and helix objects
   do not allow transparency. (Currently you can use the synonym &quot;alpha&quot; for &quot;opacity&quot;,
     but &quot;alpha&quot; is deprecated.)</p>
<h3>Surface textures</h3>
<p>You can create a texture object and then apply it to the surface of an object. 
  This capability is currently limited to boxes and spheres. A surface texture 
  is an M by N array of 1, 2, 3, or 4 numerical values (a list or tuple). M and 
  N must be powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.). Here are the possible values 
  for each slot in the array:</p>
<p>1 value: texture type must be &quot;luminance&quot; (how bright) or &quot;opacity&quot;</p>
<p>2 values (opacity,luminance): texture type must be &quot;opacity_luminance&quot;</p>
<p>3 values (red,green,blue): texture type must be &quot;rgb&quot;</p>
<p>4 values (red,green,blue,opacity or alpha): texture type must be &quot;rgbo&quot;</p>
<p>A VPython texture is basically a mask. For example, if you apply a texture 
  to a box that is red, any cyan region of the texture will display as black, 
  because the cyan (0,1,1) doesn't overlap at all with the red (1,0,0).</p>
<p>You can create a numeric array of zeros in various formats, then assign values:</p>
<p>zeros([...], ubyte) means an 8-bit unsigned integer 0-255<br>
  zeros([...], short) means a 16-bit iinteger plus or minus 0-32767<br>
  zeros([...], int) means a 32-bit integer plus or minus 0-2147483648<br>
  zeros([...], float) means a floating-point (fractional) number</p>
<p>Here is an example program in which a checkerboard texture is created and applied 
  to a box:</p>
<p>from visual import *<br>
  M=4 # must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)<br>
  N=4 # must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)<br>
  checks = zeros([M,N], float) # create a numeric array of floating-point zeros
   (0.0) <br>
  for i in range(M):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for j in range(N):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((i&amp;1) ^ (j&amp;1)): 
  # true for every alternate square of the checkerboard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks[i][j] 
  = 1.0<br>
  print checks<br>
  lum = texture(data=checks, type=&quot;luminance&quot;)<br>
  box(color=color.cyan, texture=lum)</p>
<p>If you wanted to create a texture containing &quot;rgb&quot; values, you would
   start with zeros([M,N,3], float), and entries into this array would be the
  usual 
  (red,green,blue) triples, with values for each color in the range 0-1 inclusive.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://vpython.org/contributed.html" target="_blank">contributed</a> 
  section of vpython.org for an example of a program to create, save, and use
     a wood-grain texture. Such a texture is included in the examples and used
    by the program texture_and_lighting.py.</p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>Some objects now have a &quot;shininess&quot; attribute which by default is 
  0.5 (box, sphere, cylinder, cone, ring). A shininess of 0 means no specular 
  highlights. A shininess of 1 means strong specular highlights. You can also 
  for special purposes specify an attribute &quot;lit&quot; to False (or 0) in 
  which case lights have no effect on it.</p>
<p>For compatibility with past programs, there is still a list of lights in scene.lights, 
  and you can still manipulate those lights as before. However, those lights were 
  restricted to being very far (&quot;at infinity&quot;) from the scene. Now you 
  can create lights that are nearby, and if you wish they can be spotlights with 
  directed beams. The following statement creates a local blue light positioned 
  at (x,y,z):</p>
<p>bl = light(pos=(x,y,z), color=color.blue, local=True)</p>
<p>Note that if you continually update bl.pos, the light will move.</p>
<p>By default, local is True. If you set local = False, the light is at infinity, 
  in a direction given by pos.</p>
<p>Other attributes are spot_direction (a vector), spot_cutoff (half angle of 
  the beam in degrees), diffuse_color, and specular_color. The attribute attentuation=(const, 
  linear, quadratic) makes the light diminish with distance d according to the 
  formula 1/(const + linear*d +quadratic*d). The default is (1,0,0). OpenGL guarantees 
  to permit a minimum of seven lights.</p>
<p>If you want to disable all of the old lights, say scene.lights = [], making 
  an empty list of old lights.</p>
<h3>Points object</h3>
<p>A new points object can be plotted in &quot;screen&quot; size as well as the 
  usual &quot;world&quot; coordinates. Like curve, the pos attribute is a list 
  of points, as is color. If you say shape = &quot;round&quot;, the points are round, which is the default; shape = &quot;square&quot; makes square points. You can specify the size of the points, and the default is size = 5 (meaning a square 5 pixels by 5 pixels, or a circular disk bounded by a 5 by 5 square). The size attribute is in screen pixels if the type attribute 
  is &quot;screen&quot; (the default), but if type is &quot;world&quot;, the size 
  is in the usual coordinates. A good use for the new object is for the gdots 
  displayed using visual.graph. These used to be awkward labels using the letter 
  &quot;o&quot; but have been replaced with screen-pixel points.</p>
<p> Technical caveats: If the &quot;GL_ARB_point_parameters&quot; property is 
  shown in scene.info() then type = &quot;world&quot; will work. Otherwise the 
  type is silently ignored and considered to be &quot;screen&quot;. There is an 
  implementation-defined size range for either round or square points, which is 
  not easily visible to programs at this time. Specifying a size outside this 
  range will cause it to be silently clamped internally to whatever range that 
  the hardware supports.</p>
<h3>New frame capabilities</h3>
<p>You can now make a frame visible or invisible, and all objects in the frame 
  will be affected. And you can set the vector &quot;scale&quot; attribute of 
  a frame to change the size of the combined object.</p>
<h3>New aspects of curves </h3>
<p>In older versions of VPython, no matter how many points were in a curve, only 1000 were displayed, selected evenly over the full set of points, in order that the display of a very long curve doesn't slow down unacceptably. In the new version this is still true but the number of points displayed is 10000. </p>
<p>The new option curve.retain = 500 means that only the 500 most recently added points of a curve will be displayed; the earlier ones are deleted. This is a nice option for having a moving object leave a tail behind itself. </p>
<h3>Nonuniform axes</h3>
<p>The option  scene.uniform = False now facilitates making graphs of functions
  and is used by the module visual.graph. The option is useful for making 2D
  displays whose x and y scale factors are different. The only objects supported
  are curve, faces, points, and label. Set the scale factors with scene.range.</p>
<h3>Fonts in labels</h3>
<p>You can now specify font='times' or 'system' or 'symbol' etc. in a label object. 
</p>
<h3>Specifying a gray</h3>
<p>For convenience you can now say color=0.7 to mean color=(0.7,0.7,0.7).</p>
<h3>Titlebar and toolbar heights </h3>
<p>The height in pixels of the titlebar is given by display.get_titlebar_height(), and the height of the (to be optional) toolbar is given by display.get_toolbar_height(). These values are true for all windows, and these functions are associated with the display class of objects, not with individual displays such as the standard scene. So scene.get_titlebar_height() won't work..</p>
<h3>Render time  </h3>
<p>If you say scene.show_rendertime = True, in the lower left os the graphics window you will see the cycle time (time between renderings of the scene) and the render time (time taken to render the scene. This can be a useful diagnostic of performance issues. .</p>
<h3><a name="bugs"></a>Known bugs in this beta version</h3>
<p>Here are known bugs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Can drag a window to be larger, but not smaller. </p>
  <p>A program loop containing essentially no computation at all may be difficult to quit on Windows. The cure is<br>
    to insert a rate statement, for example, rate(100). </p>
  <p>Autoscaling is pretty good but occasionally positions the camera farther 
    from the scene than you would prefer.</p>
  <p>Rendering of curves isn't quite right. This can be seen in the example program 
    tictac.py, where one of the grid lines doesn't show until you rotate the view.</p>
  <p>Unicode text in labels works properly on Linux but not on Windows. </p>
  <p>Spotlights created in a frame don't change with changes in the frame orientation.</p>
  <p>scene.cursor is not implemented yet and gives an error (used in old programs 
    to make cursor visible/invisible).</p>
  <p>Stereo modes &quot;active&quot; and &quot;crosseyed&quot; are not implemented yet.</p>
