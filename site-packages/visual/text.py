# Display extruded text (uppercase only at present)
# By default, display text along x axis, with letters pointing up parallel to y axis
# Bruce Sherwood, Carnegie Mellon University, begun March 2000, revised June 2006

# Example with default values:
#  text(pos=(0,0,0), axis=(1,0,0), string='ABC',
#    height=1, depth=0, width=1,
#    color=currentdisplay.foreground, up=(0,1,0.3))
# Axis is direction along which text advances.
# If width not specified, it is the same as height.
# Depth is measured forward from pos.
# Only numbers and uppercase letters at present: others display as '*'
# If justify is "center" pos is the center of the text.
# If justify is "right" pos is the right end of the text.
# The reshape method lets you change the pos, width, height, and color
# of an existing text.
# You can set the visible attribute of the text.
