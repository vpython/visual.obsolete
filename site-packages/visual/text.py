# Display extruded text (uppercase only at present)
# By default, display text along x axis, with letters pointing up parallel to y axis
# Bruce Sherwood, Carnegie Mellon University, begun March 2000

# Example with default values:
#  text(pos=(0,0,0), axis=(1,0,0), string='ABC',
#    height=1, depth=0, width=1,
#    color=currentdisplay.foreground, up=(0,1,0.3))
# axis is direction along which text advances
# if width not specified, it is the same as height
# depth is measured forward from pos
# Only numbers and uppercase letters at present: others display as '*'
