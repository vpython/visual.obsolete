I.  Prerequisites:
	Most or all of these may be provided by your operating system 
	distributor.  In every case, you must have the "developer" version
	of the packages to ensure that the required header files are 
	available.

	GNU g++ version 3.2.x or >= 3.3.1 (3.4.6 reccomended) (gcc.gnu.org).
	Python 2.2.x or 2.3.x or 2.4.x (www.python.org).
	The Boost C++ libraries version 1.31 and higher (1.33.1 reccomended)
		(www.boost.org).  Note that 1.31 is required if you are using Python 
		2.3 or higher, and is reccomended in any case due to getting much
		better error messages.  1.32.0 or higher is required if you want to use
		GNU G++ 3.4.0 or higher to build the suite.
	GtkGLExtmm 1.2.x (gtkglext.sourceforge.net); not needed for Windows.
	libglademm (www.gtkmm.org); not needed for Windows.
	Numeric Python AND/OR the Python Numarray library (numpy.sourceforge.net).
	An implementation of OpenGL.
	
	On Microsoft Windows, MinGW and MSYS are required to build VPython from 
	source.
	
	A.  Apple OSX (Version 10.2.x) WARNING: This is woefully out of date
		- Go to www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download and download
		both X11 and the X11 SDK.
		- Install fink from fink.sourceforge.net.  Answer 'y' when asked
		about adding a line to ~/.cshrc.  You do not need to run
		'dselect'.
		- In a terminal editor run the following:
		rehash
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install pkgconfig gtk+ gtkglarea python22
		rehash
		which python2.2 (Verify this reports /sw/bin/python2.2)
		Install GCC from source using version 3.3.1 or higher.  First
		install the Apple Developer's Tools (called XCode in 10.3)
		including an installation of GCC 3.3.  Download and unpack
		the sources for GCC from gcc.gnu.org.  This creates a directory 
		named like 'gcc-3.3.3'.  Make a new directory alongside this 
		directory, such as 'buildgcc3.3.3'. cd into the new directory and
		 run: 
		`../gcc-3.3.3/configure --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-shared \
		--enable-version-specific-runtime-libs --program-suffix=-3.3.3 \
		--enable-threads=posix`
		Build the new compiler with `make bootstrap`.  Optionally, to save
		some disk space, build with `make CXXFLAGS=-O2`, instead.
		install the compiler with `sudo make install`
		Download
		OpenGL is provided with the standard OS installation.
	# TODO: include directions for building Boost.Python on OSX(gulp).
	
	B.  Microsoft Windows # Also really out of date
		Download and install the MinGW 3.1 and MSYS 1.0.9 packages from
		www.mingw.org.  Also download the MinGW Utils package (version 0.1 or
		higher).  You may need to add C:\mingw\bin to your PATH.
		Download and install Python 2.4.x from www.python.org.
		OpenGL is provided with the standard OS installation.
		
		From an MSYS shell run the following:
		> pexports /c/windows/system32/python24.dll > libpython24.def
		> dlltool --input-def libpython24.def --output-lib libpython24.a
		Copy the resulting libpython24.a into C:\mingw\lib
		See http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/tweak-flags.html for discussion.
		It appears that Python2.4 for Windows ships with such a file in Python/libs.
		However, it appears that the standard msys machinery doesn't look in Python/libs.
		
		Download a precompiled version of the 'bjam' tool from www.boost.org 
		and place it into C:\mingw\bin (or anywhere else on your PATH).
		Download and unpack the Boost source tree.
		In MSYS:
		> cd boost_1_31_0/libs/python/build
		> bjam -sTOOLS=mingw -sPYTHON_VERSION=2.4 -sPYTHON_ROOT=C:/Python24
		> cp bin-stage/boost_python.dll /mingw/bin/
		
		> pexports bin-stage/boost_python.dll > libboost_python24.def
		> dlltool --input-def libboost_python24.def --output-lib libboost_python24.a
		> cp libboost_python24.a /mingw/lib/
		
		> cd boost_1_31_0/libs/thread/build
		> bjam -sTOOLS=mingw
		> cp bin-stage/boost_thread-mgw-mt-d-1_31d.dll /mingw/bin/
		> cp bin-stage/boost_thread-mgw-mt-d-1_31d.lib /mingw/lib/
		In /mingw/lib, change the name of this .lib file to libboost_thread.a
		
		Copy boost_1_31_0/boost to /mingw/include/
		
	C.  GNU/Linux
		Please note that these package lists are my best-guess based on 
		browsing the various package listings.  If you have any corrections or
		additions please write to visualpython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
		
		Users of Debian Sid, Sarge, and derivatives such as Ubuntu will need these packages:
			python2.4-dev
			python2.4-numeric-ext *
			python2.4-numarray-ext *
			libglademm-2.4-dev
			g++
			libboost-python-dev
			libboost-thread-dev
			libboost-dev
			libglu-dev ((libglu1-mesa-dev and libgl1-mesa-dri) OR nvidia-glx-dev) **
			GtkGLExtmm 1.2.x and GtkGLExt 1.2.x from source (gtkglext.sourceforge.net)
			  (On Ubuntu it was necessary to remove the existing GtkGLExt and then build
			  from source with ./configure --prefix=/usr, make, install, because although
			  it is really version 1.2, it shows up as version 1.0.)
		
		* VPython may be built against Numeric, Numarray, or both.  If you
		build VPython with support for both, you can select which library
		you want to use for array objects at runtime.

		** libglu-dev doesn't exist; it is Provided by other packages.  If 
		you use Mesa+DRI, then xlibmesa-glu-dev will meet this requirement.
		If you use NVIDIA's non-free OpenGL drivers you will need
		nvidia-glx-dev.  Other drivers may require you to use a specific -dev
		package for that driver.
			
		Users of Debian Sarge and derivatives will need to obtain backports 
		of some of the above from (eg.) www.backports.org.
		
		WARNING: The following is out of date; Notes from a Fedora or Suse
			user are welcome.
		Users of RPM-based systems will need the following packages and their
		dependancies:
			boost-python-devel
			python-devel
			python-numeric
			gtk+-devel
			gtkglarea-devel
			g++
		
		WARNING: Also out-of-date...
		Users of Gentoo will need these packages and their dependancies from
		portage:
			boost
			gcc
			Python
			gtk+
			gtkglarea
			numeric
		
		If you are using Gentoo and have numarray (<1.0) installed, you must
		pass --without-numarray to VPython's configure.
		
		WARNING: You cannot build some dependancies with G++ 3.3.x or 3.2.x and
		others with G++ 3.4.x; the two are not compatable with each other.  I
		think that 3.4.x is compatable with 4.0.x and 4.1.x.
			
		You must have an implementation of OpenGL (aka GLX) installed on your
		system.  Mesa (and the DRI), Nvidia, and ATI each provide usable GLX
		implementaions.  Properly configuring OpenGL may involve editing
		/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 (or xorg.conf) and is not covered here.  A simple 
		operational test is to run the `glxgears` program.
		

II.   Configuration 
	On most systems, configuration should be automatic.  Just run 'configure'.

	However, configure also provides a large number of options and is sensitive to 
	several environment variables to properly configure VPython for unique use cases. 
	Additionally, it is a good idea to build VPython in a directory separate from the
	source tree.  Just run configure with the fully-qualified path to it, eg (from a
	directory alongside visual-2.9) `../visual-2.9/configure`
	
	Run `configure --help` for the complete list of options and brief descriptions.
	
	If you have multiple versions of Python installed, and the one named 'python' that
	is first on your PATH (identified with `which python`) is not the one you want to 
	build Visual for, specify the correct interpreter by setting the PYTHON
	environment variable to the desired interpreter's full path.
	
	If you have multiple versions of GNU G++ installed, and the default is inadequate
	for VPython, specify the correct one by setting the CXX environment variable to
	its fully-qualified path.
	
	If you have both Numarray and Numeric Python installed, and you want to
	explicitly disable support for one of them, use the option 
	--without-numarray, or --without-numeric, as appropriate.
	
	If you are using G++ 3.3.x on Darwin, you must set the CXXFLAGS environment 
	variable to	include "-finline-functions".  You should also include "-O2".  All of 
	these options must be separated by whitespace.
	
	You should generally supply the --prefix option to cause Visual to be installed to
	the same prefix that Python is installed (default is /usr/local).
	
	On Linux, do this: which python
	Make a note of the prefix preceding /bin/python, typically /usr or /usr/local.
	
	(a) If prefix is /usr/local, execute
     	../visual-x.x.x/configure
	(b) If prefix is something else, and Visual can go into prefix/lib/python/site-packages, execute
     	../visual-x.x.x/configure --prefix=prefix
	(c) If you want to use a different version of Python than the one found with "which python",
   		or (b) is not appropriate, specify both the particular Python and where to install Visual:
      	PYTHON=/somewhere1/bin/python ../visual-x.x.x/configure --prefix=/somewhere2
	If "somewhere1" and "somewhere2" are different, you must also add the "somewhere2"
	directory to Python's module search path. For details, at www.python.org read section 4.1
	(Modifying Python's Search Path) in the section Installing Python Modules of the Python
	on-line documentation.
	
	If you are only building VPython once, you may pass the option
	--disable-dependancy-tracking to make the build itself go a little faster.
	
	If your GNOME libraries are installed in a non-standard location (such as 
	/sw in OSX fink, or /opt/gnome in SUSE), you must set the CPPFLAGS 
	environment variable to -I/other_prefix/include to ensure that you pick up
	the gtkglarea header files.
	
	The prebuilt binary for MS Windows is configured with (in MSYS):
	CXXFLAGS="-O2 -finline-functions -march=i686" PYTHON=/c/Python24/python \
	PYTHONPATH="c:\Python24\lib\site-packages" ../visual-2.9/configure
	
	The prebuilt binary for Apple OSX is configured with (in Bash):
	CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-3.3.3 CXXFLAGS="-O2 -finline-functions" \
	PYTHON=/sw/bin/python CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include ../visual-2.9/configure \
	--prefix=/sw
	
	Another interesting configuration is to install VPython into a prefix other than
	the same prefix that Python is installed in.  This may be useful to test your
	VPython programs with different versions of Visual on the same system
	simultaneously.  After choosing an approprate prefix, such as /home/jonathan, run
	configure as normally but specify the PYTHONPATH environment variable to be
	[prefix]/lib/python2.4/site-packages, replacing python2.4 with python2.2 if that
	is your interpreter.  You must create this PYTHONPATH directory if it does not
	already exist.
	
	WARNING: If you are using a Pentium 4 and glibc 2.3.2 or earlier, and are
	enabling numarray support, do not use -march=pentium4 or -mfpmath=sse as 
	compiler options in CXXFLAGS or CFLAGS.  There is a bug in this version 
	of glibc, triggered by numarray, that will lead to SIGFPE (Floating Point
	Error) at runtime.

III.  Build
	Just run 'make'.  
	
	Optionally, you may override the following variables by
	specifying them in the form VARIABLE=value as arguments to make:
	LDFLAGS, LIBS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS affect options passed to the linker,
	compiler, and preprocessor, respectively.
	DESTDIR may be used to prepend DESTDIR to the 'prefix' specified when running
	configure.  This option is mostly useful to binary redistributors of VPython.
	
	If you want debugging symbols in your build (adds roughly 70 MB of data to the
	final object file), you must manually edit cvisual/Makefile and remove `-g0` from
	the CXXFLAGS variable.
	
	The Makefiles support the following targets:
	all: (the default) compiles all the required software
	clean: deletes files created by the compiler
	distclean: deletes all files created by the configure and make programs.  This
		option is useful if you want to start over from a clean source tree.
	install: copies all required files in the locations specified by configure
	install-strip: Performs the 'install' target and strips the final object files.
		It also makes getting a backtrace impossible on most platforms. 

IV.  Install
	You must have write privaleges to the installation directory to proceed.  Unless
	you are installing into your home directory, that generally means becoming root
	with a program like `sudo` or `su`
	On Apple OSX, run `sudo make install`
	On MS Windows, there usually isn't a distinction between administrators and
	normal users, so you can just run 'make install'
	
	Alternatively, you may run 'make install-strip' to install a somewhat smaller
	executable.

V:   Troubleshooting
	The single most likely cause of an error in the build is that one or more
	develoment header files could not be found.  VPython logs its configuration stage
	in config.log, and its build stage in src/build.log.  If the build fails you
	must read src/build.log to see what happened.  In the event that you cannot
	solve the problem, compress config.log and src/build.log and include them with
	your request for assistance to visualpython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
	
	But before you do that, it is a good idea to read the archives of the mailing list
	since someone else has probably worked through your problem already.

VI:	  Notes for redistributors
	If you are redistributing a binary package of VPython for a particular
	system, the appropriate build-dependancy is to build Visual with support
	for both Numeric and Numarray.  The runtime-dependancy is one or the other
	or both.  It is perfectly safe to build Visual with support for both and
	only have one installed when running it on another machine.
