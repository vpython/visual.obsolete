Building vpython with from Visual Studio C++ 		
	
	a)Vpython cvs
	        Check-out the vpython-core2 module from
		:pserver:anonymous@visualpython.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython

	b)Python25
		Install Python 2.5.x via the Windows Installer at http://www.python.org/download/.
		Make sure it is installed on the same drive as vpython-core2, in /Python25/.

	c)VPython installer
		Install VPython from the normal installer.  Technically it is only required to install
                numpy(?) but this will tend to get you the latest dependencies.

        d)Install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and platform SDK as per the instructions at
        	http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/
			Note that you need to go to the bottom of the SDK page to get the 2003 download.
        
        e)Unzip Boost
                Extract the files in vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_1_34_1.zip so that there
                is a folder vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_1_34_1.
        
	f)Install package (might be optional)
                Delete the /Python25/lib/site-packages/visual folder and replace it with:
                    vpython-core2/site-packages/visual
                    vpython-core2/visual/docs
                    vpython-core2/visual/examples

		(You installed VPython already, but the CVS version might have changes to files other than 
                cvisual.pyd)

        g)Build cvisual.pyd
             Open the cvisual.sln project file in Visual Studio Express, make Release the active 
             configuration, then on the Build menu choose "Build Solution".

             The .pyd file will be placed directly in the Python25/lib/site-packages/visual folder, ready to run!

             This is the only step that needs to be repeated as you make changes to the C++ source code.
