Building vpython with from Visual Studio C++ 

	You may find Eclipse a useful development and CVS environment (eclipse.org)		
	
	VPython CVS
	    Check-out the vpython-core2 module from
		:pserver:anonymous@visualpython.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython

	Python25
		Install Python 2.5.x via the Windows Installer at http://www.python.org/download/.
		Make sure it is installed on the same drive as vpython-core2, in \Python25.
                
    Install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, which includes the platform SDK, from
        http://www.microsoft.com/Express/Download/#webInstall

    Unzip Boost
        Extract the files in vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_files2.5.zip so that 
        there is a folder vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_files containing 
        boost (include files) and win_libs folders.
        
        These files were obtained from http://www.boostpro.com/products/free
        (If these files are not up to date with the current Python, you may have to
        build the Boost libraries from source. See below. This was the case in 
        Oct. 2008 when the standard release of Python was 2.6, but the boostpro 
        libraries had been built for Python 2.5.)
        
	On Vista, in Command Prompt, link from Python site-packages to the CVS files
	(YourCVS is the directory where you have put the CVS files)
        cd C:\Python25\lib\site-packages
		mklink /D visual \YourCVS\vpython-core2\site-packages\visual
	
	If you are using XP, you will need to copy/update these files 
		from CVS to C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages:
			visual, examples, docs

	Build cvisual.pyd
        Open the cvisual.sln project file in Visual Studio Express, make Release the active 
        configuration, then on the Build menu choose "Build Solution".

        The .pyd file is placed in vpython-core2\site-packages\visual, ready to run!
        (On XP, you need to copy this file to C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\visual)

        This is the only step that needs to be repeated as you make changes to the C++ source code.
        (On XP, you need to copy over any Visual .py files that change.)
    
    Process MakeVPython.iss with Innosetup (innosetup.org) to build an installer
    
BUILDING BOOST FROM SOURCE
Download a precompiled version of the 'bjam' tool from www.boost.org.

Download latest Boost (boost_1_35_0.zip, for example) from www.boost.org.
Unzip into boost_1_35_0, for example.

The following must be done from a Windows typescript, NOT from Msys.
(From Start/Run, execute cmd.)
> cd boost_1_35_0

Make sure that the target Python is the only Python installed (-a means rebuild all):
bjam --toolset=msvc --build-type=complete --with-python --with-thread --with-signals stage

"complete" means "make various variants of the libraries".
Look in stage/lib to find the static multithreading library files:
libboost_python-vc90-mt-1_35.lib
libboost_python-vc90-mt-gd-1_35.lib
libboost_python-vc90-mt-s-1_35.lib
libboost_python-vc90-mt-sgd-1_35.lib
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-1_35.lib
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-gd-1_35.lib
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-s-1_35.lib
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-sgd-1_35.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-1_35.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-gd-1_35.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-s-1_35.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-sgd-1_35.lib

These go into dependencies\boost\win_libs 

2008/10/19 and attempt was made to use Boost 1_36_0 with Python 2.6 which failed.
Built python, thread, signals Boost libraries 1_36_0 for Python 2.6 and got these 
errors when building Visual using msvc:
