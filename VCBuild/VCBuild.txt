Building vpython with from Visual Studio C++ 

	You may find Eclipse a useful development and CVS environment (eclipse.org)		
	
	VPython CVS
	    Check-out the vpython-core2 module from
		:pserver:anonymous@visualpython.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython

	Python25
		Install Python 2.5.x via the Windows Installer at http://www.python.org/download/.
		Make sure it is installed on the same drive as vpython-core2, in \Python25.
                
    Install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, which includes the platform SDK, from
        http://www.microsoft.com/Express/Download/#webInstall

    Unzip Boost
        Extract the files in vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_1_35_0.zip so that there
        is a folder vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_1_35_0 containing boost and lib directories.
        
        These files were obtained from http://www.boostpro.com/products/free
        
	On Vista, in Command Prompt, link from Python site-packages to the CVS files
	(YourCVS is the directory where you have put the CVS files)
        cd \Python25\lib\site-packages
		mklink /D visual \YourCVS\vpython-core2\site-packages\visual
	
	If you are using XP, you will need to copy/update these files 
		from CVS to C:\Python\Python25\Lib\site-packages:
			visual, examples, docs

	Build cvisual.pyd
        Open the cvisual.sln project file in Visual Studio Express, make Release the active 
        configuration, then on the Build menu choose "Build Solution".

        The .pyd file is placed in vpython-core2\site-packages\visual, ready to run!
        (On XP, you need to copy this file to C:\Python\Python25\Lib\site-packages\visual)

        This is the only step that needs to be repeated as you make changes to the C++ source code.
        (On XP, you need to copy over any Visual .py files that change.)
    
    Process MakeVPython.iss with Innosetup (innosetup.org) to build an installer
